In this automation exercise, you'll automate core functionalities of the Parabank online banking application using Selenium, TestNG, and Cucumber with Data-Driven Testing. The key test scenarios include:

Register a New Account: Automate the user registration process by filling out dynamic data (like name, address, and credentials) using data-driven testing from Cucumber's Scenario Outline. This allows testing registration with multiple sets of user data.
Log in to the Application: Log in with different sets of credentials to validate both successful and unsuccessful login attempts. Use data-driven testing to verify login functionality for multiple users.
Create a New Savings Account: Once logged in, automate the creation of a savings account.
Transfer Amount Between Accounts: Automate the process of transferring funds between accounts.
